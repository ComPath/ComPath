"""
An interactive and extensible web application for comparative analysis of pathway databases

This package exposes the Bio2BEL pathway packages into a web application containing multiple built-in visualization and
analytics tools allowing for their analysis and comparison. By default, this packages wraps the following default
packages:

- `Bio2BEL KEGG <https://github.com/bio2bel/kegg>`_
- `Bio2BEL Reactome <https://github.com/bio2bel/reactome>`_
- `Bio2BEL WikiPathways <https://github.com/bio2bel/wikipathways>`_
- `Bio2BEL MSig <https://github.com/bio2bel/msig>`_

New pathway/gene signatures resources can be added by forking the `ComPath Template Repository <https://github.com/compath/compath_template>`_.

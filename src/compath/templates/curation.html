                <p>As an application scenario, ComPath was used to generate mapping files across pathway databases in
                    order to establish the multiple relationships between equivalent or related pathways in three of the
                    major pathway databases (<a href="http://www.kegg.jp/">KEGG</a>, <a href="https://reactome.org/">Reactome</a>,
                    and <a href="https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways">WikiPathways</a>). The protocol
                    established for the mapping is described below.
                </p>

                <h4>Mapping Files</h4>

                <p>A total of 3 mapping files were curated, one for each pairwise comparison:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>KEGG vs Reactome</li>
                    <li>KEGG vs WikiPathways</li>
                    <li>Reactome vs WikiPathways</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Description</h4>

                <p>
                    For each pairwise pathway database comparison (resource 1 vs resource 2), they will be a unique
                    template containing the following columns:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Reference pathway from resource 1</b>. E.g., 'Akt signaling'.</li>

                    <li><b>Proposed mapping pathways according to content similarity</b> (Point 1 in the next section).
                        The pathways (resource 2) are represented by an ordered list of top 10 most similar pathways
                        together with the values of similarity (%). E.g., ['Akt signaling pathway'|90%, 'MAPK
                        signaling'|50%]
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Proposed mapping pathways according to name similarity</b> (Point 2 in the next section). The
                        pathways (resource 2) are represented by an ordered list of the top 5 most similar pathways.
                        E.g., ['Akt signaling pathway', 'Example signaling'...]
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Curator's proposed mapping</b>. This column contains the mappings proposed by the curator. In
                        case there is more than one pathway, the mappings need to be separated by pipes (|). E.g., "Akt
                        signaling pathway equivalentTo Akt pathways|Akt signaling pathway isPartOf Akt family pathways")
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Curator explanation</b>. Arguments behind the mapping, needed for the inter-curator
                        agreement.
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p>
                    We have chosen to use the top of most similar pathways instead of presenting the curator with the
                    full list due to the vast amount of overlapping pathways. If we present the curator with 100
                    pathways to analyze against one, the curator would need huge amount of time. Instead, the curator is
                    presented with overlapping pathways, order by similarity and top 5 pathways with the most similar
                    name based on string similarity. While the ranked pathway list based on similarity provides insight
                    on pathways sharing genetic similarity, the other one gives suggestion on possible pathways based on
                    the name. Furthermore, hyperlinks to the description were attached so that the curator can confirm
                    that the focus and context of the pathways remain the same, even if the both have high similarity
                    and name.
                </p>

                <h4>Inter-curator agreement</h4>

                <p>
                    The final step of the curation process is to agree on the proposed mappings. Therefore, all three
                    curators examined together one by one the mapping files and compare the differences,
                    and subsequently agreeing on the final mappings.

                <p>ComPath curation interface allows for two types of mappings: equivalentTo and isPartOf.</p>

                <ul>

                    <li><b>equivalentTo</b>.reflects that the pathway pair shares a high similarity. The guidelines for
                        this mapping are:

                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                The pair should share at least a certain degree of similarity (this is required). In
                                other words, only pathways with at least 1 overlapping gene can be used for the mapping.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Same focus and biological function. A high concordance in the name between the pair is
                                not required but it is helpful to identify this similarity. Curators have read
                                the descriptions for each database to assess whether the focus of the pathway is the
                                same or not.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>isPartOf</b>.This type of mapping represents a hierarchical relationship between the pathway
                        1 (child) and 2 (parent).
                    </li>
